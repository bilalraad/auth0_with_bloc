# oauth_with_bloc

A new project created to try authentication with auth0 and BLOC state managment.

## Getting Started

First you need to create a file caleed const.dart in the data folder and paste this inside the folder you created:

```
//e.g. your-username.us.auth0.com
const AUTH0_DOMAIN = 'YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN';
const AUTH0_CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID';

//NOTE: the package name shouldn't have spaces or underscores
const AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI = 'com.bilal.auth0withbloc://login-callback';
const AUTH0_ISSUER = 'https://$AUTH0_DOMAIN';

const CAT_API_KEY = "YOUR_CAT_API_KEY";
```

## To get these values, First:

### a - make an auth0 account [here](https://auth0.com/)

### b - After creating an Auth0 account, follow the steps below to set up an application:

> Go to the Applications section of your dashboard.

> Click on the "Create Application" button.

> Enter a name for your application (e.g., "Flutter Application").

> Finally, select Native as the application type and click the Create button.

Your application should have at least one enabled Connection. Click on the "Connections" tab on your application page and switch on any database or social identity provider (e.g., Google).

</br>
</br>

Use the values of Domain and Client ID from your Application settings as the values of `AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`.
